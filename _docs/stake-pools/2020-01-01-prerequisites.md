Running a stake pool requires a certain amount of technical expertise. Stake pool operators are expected to ensure that their node is running 24/7, both to support the operation of the Cardano network and to provide a high quality of service to their delegators. Stake pools on the Cardano network are not moderated in any way, but poor stake pool performance will naturally lead to reduced rewards, a poor stake pool ranking, and fewer delegators.

## Suggested skills for stake pool operators
* operational knowledge of how to [run a Cardano node](link to running a Cardano node section)
* server administration skills
* system operation skills

Stake pool operators also require the necessary technical infrastructure to run a Cardano node 24/7. There are no strict guidelines in this regard, and operators should consider their personal expertise, potential operating costs, and availability of any hardware they choose to use to run their node.
