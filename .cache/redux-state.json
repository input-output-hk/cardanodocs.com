Please notice that Cardano SL\nimplementation differs from the paper, [read about\ndifferences](/cardano/differences/) for more details.\n\n## Peer Discovery\n\nA way how a node can find other nodes after running. Peer discovery we use is\nbased on Kademlia DHT. Please read [a Kademlia\npaper](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf)\nfor technical details.\n\n## Plutus\n\nStrictly typed pure functional programming language used for defining smart\ncontracts in Cardano. Please read about\n[Plutus](/technical/plutus/introduction/) for more details.\n\n## Proof of Stake\n\nOuroboros Proof of Stake algorithm is the most important part of the [protocol](#paper).\nIt defines the way [nodes](#node) reach consensus about the state of [ledger](#ledger).\nPlease read about [Ouroboros Proof of Stake Algorithm](/cardano/proof-of-stake/)\nfor more details.\n\n## PVSS\n\nPVSS (Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing) is a cryptographic scheme we use in [SSC](#ssc).\nPlease read about [PVSS implementation in Cardano SL](/technical/pvss/) for more details.\n\n## Richman\n\nStakeholder with stake enough for participation in some action.

Please read [paper](#paper) (page 7) for technical details.\n\n## SSC\n\nSSC (Shared Seed Computation) is a part of [slot leader election](#leader-election)\nprocess. This part is implemented as a [Coin Tossing](#coin-tossing) protocol with\n[Guaranteed Output Delivery](#guaranteed-output-delivery). As a result of SSC we get\na randomness which will be used in [Follow The Satoshi](#follow-the-satoshi) mechanism.\n\n## Stake\n\nPlease read about [Balance and Stake in Cardano SL](/cardano/balance-and-stake/)\nfor explanation.\n\n## Stakeholder\n\nA node with a positive stake.\n\n## Transaction\n\nThe data that represents the act of transferring value.

It is\na hashed public key. Read more about public key addresses [below](#public-key-addresses).\n\nScript address is used in so-called \"Pay to Script Hash\" (P2SH) transactions.\nIt operates autonomously and acts somewhat like a bank deposit: you can send\nmoney to it, but in order to redeem it you have to satisfy certain conditions,\ndetermined by a script associated with the address. The address itself contains\nthe hash of the serialized script. Read more about P2SH [below](#pay-to-script-hash).\n<!-- end -->\nRedeem address is a special type of address for ADA redemption. Read more about redeem\naddresses [below](#redeem-addresses).\n\nMoreover, Cardano SL support `Unknown` address type as well. This type will allow us to use\ncustom types of addresses in the future.\n\n## What Does an Address Look Like?\n\nAddresses are `base58`-encoded bytestrings, for example:\n\n```\nAe2tdPwUPEZKmwoy3AU3cXb5Chnasj6mvVNxV1H11997q3VW5ihbSfQwGpm\n```\n\n### Encoding\n\n`base58` encoding is the same one as used in Bitcoin. It uses a 58-symbol alphabet\nto encode data, hence the name. Here is the alphabet we are using:\n\n```\n123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz\n```\n\nIt avoids both non-alphanumeric characters and letters which might look\nambiguous when printed (`0`, `O`, `I`, `l`); therefore it is suitable for human\nusers who enter the data manually, copying it from some visual source, and also\nallows easy copy and paste by double-clicking which usually selects the whole\nstring.\n\n## Public Key Addresses\n\nAs mentioned in the [Introduction](/introduction/#you-own-your-money), the wallets\nyou can see in the user interface are a convenient representation of the fact that\nyou own a secret key to spend money in this particular wallet. But how is such\nspending verified by the network and how can you receive money from others? The\nanswer is that along with the secret key which is used to control the value in\nyour wallets, a public key is generated. This public component can be known by\nanybody, hence the name.\n\nA public key address contains the hash of this public key.\n\nPublic keys are also used for verifying your identity when you create a\ntransaction and other auxiliary purposes.\n\n## Pay to Script Hash\n\nThe idea of Pay to Script Hash (P2SH) is to provide a lot of flexibility for\nformulating complex rules for spending money. Instead of sending a transaction\nto a public key address, we create a validator script that can take a so-called\nredemption script as a parameter. To redeem funds, we pass the redemption script\nto the validator and evaluate it. If it evaluates to `success`, money is sent as\nspecified by the redeemer. Otherwise nothing happens.\n\nTo quote Bitcoin Wiki,\n\n> Using P2SH, you can send bitcoins to an address that is secured in various\n> unusual ways without knowing anything about the details of how the security is\n> set up. The recipient might need the signatures of several people to spend\n> these bitcoins, or a password might be required, or the requirements could be\n> completely unique.\n\n## Redeem Addresses\n\nRedeem addresses are Pay To PubKey Hash (P2PKH). Such an address contains the hash\nof redeem public key, and this key is actually [Ed25519](http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/)\npublic key.\n\n## Other Address Types\n\nIn the future, we may use the update system to introduce other address types. Please\n[see more](/cardano/update-mechanism/#soft-fork-updates) on extending the system in\nnon-breaking fashion.\n\n## Address Structure\n\nAddress consists of 3 parts:\n\n*  address root,\n*  address attributes,\n*  address type.\n\nWe can imagine an address as a JSON-like structure, for example:\n\n```\nAddress {\n    addrRoot = AbstractHash e63175c654dfd93a9290342a067158dc0f57a1108ddbd8cace3839bd,\n    addrAttributes = Attributes {\n        data: AddrAttributes {\n            aaPkDerivationPath = Nothing,\n            aaStakeDistribution = BootstrapEraDistr\n        } \n    },\n    addrType = ATPubKey\n}\n```\n\n`addrRoot` is the BLAKE2b-224 hash of the tuple made from `addrType`, `addrSpendingData` and `addrAttributes`.\n\n`addrSpendingData` is a special value which is bound to an address and must be revealed in order to spend coins belonging to\nthis address. For example, for public key address this value contains the public key. In this case, it is impossible to change\naddress attributes without knowing of the public key because if the attributes have been changed the whole address becomes\ninvalid.\n\n`addrAttributes` include important attributes of each address: derivation path and stake distribution.\n\nFor more info about derivation path please read [HD Wallets in Cardano SL](https://cardanodocs.com/technical/hd-wallets/) chapter.\n\nFor more info about stake distribution please read [Transactions in Cardano SL](https://cardanodocs.com/cardano/transactions/#stake-distribution)\nchapter.\n\nValue of `addrType` corresponds to address type as was mentioned above, in this example it is a public key address.\n\n### Length\n\nAddresses may have different lengths depending on address type and additional data in it.\n\nFor example, this address\n\n```\nAe2tdPwUPEZKmwoy3AU3cXb5Chnasj6mvVNxV1H11997q3VW5ihbSfQwGpm\n```\n\nand this one\n\n```\n4swhHtxKapQbj3TZEipgtp7NQzcRWDYqCxXYoPQWjGyHmhxS1w1TjUEszCQT1sQucGwmPQMYdv1FYs3d51KgoubviPBf\n```\n\nare both public key addresses.\n",

This is why all thresholds in the Cardano SL protocol are expressed in terms of stake, rather than balance.\n\nThus, when we refer to the stake, we are talking about the user's ability to control the actual Cardano SL. For more information about stake, please refer to the following [paper](/glossary/#paper). \n\n### The Relationship Between Balance and Stake\n\nEvery coin in Cardano SL is associated with a balance and with a stake. We use [transaction output](/cardano/transactions/#design)\nto associate coin `C` with a user's balance, and we use [stake distribution](/cardano/transactions/#stake-distribution)\nto associate coin `C` with a user's stake.\n\nNote: It is possible to change the association between coin and stake using what is known as [stake delegation](/technical/delegation/).\n",

        "content": "---\ndoc_title: Transaction Fees\npath: /en/cardano/transaction-fees/\ngroup: cardano\nlanguage: en\nlabel: docs\n---\n\n# Transaction Fees in Cardano SL\n\n## Motivation\n\nThere are two main reasons why transaction fees are needed for Cardano SL:\n\n1.  People who run full Cardano SL nodes spend time, money and effort to run the protocol, for which they should\n    be compensated and rewarded. In contrast to Bitcoin, where new currency is created with each mined block,\n    in Cardano SL, transaction fees are the only source of income for participants in the protocol.\n2.  The second reason is the prevention of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. In a DDoS attack, an attacker\n    tries to flood the network with dummy transactions, and if he has to pay a sufficiently high fee for each of those\n    dummy transactions, this form of attack will become prohibitively expensive for him.\n<!-- end -->\n## How transaction fees work\n\nWhenever somebody wants to transfer an amount of Ada, some minimal fees are computed for that transaction.

In contrast to Bitcoin, where new currency is created with each mined block,\n    in Cardano SL, transaction fees are the only source of income for participants in the protocol.\n2.  The second reason is the prevention of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.

Cardano\nSL is based on the Haskell implementation of the white paper\n[\"Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof of Stake Blockchain Protocol\"](https://iohk.io/research/papers/#9BKRHCSI)\nby Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russell, Bernardo David and Roman Oliynykov.\n\nYou can think of Cardano SL as Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix Bitcoin’s\ndesign flaws. Please read [\"What Makes Cardano SL Special?\"](https://cardanodocs.com/introduction/#what-makes-cardano-sl-special)\nfor more information about similarities and differences between Cardano SL and Bitcoin.\n<!-- CARDANO_SL_README_END_1 -->\n\n## Cryptocurrency Basics\n\nBefore giving a definition of a cryptocurrency, let's talk about why we care\nabout digital currencies in general and cryptographic currencies in particular.\n\n### Why Do We Care?\n\n#### Speed\n\nAs opposed to conventional (also known as fiat), centrally banked currencies,\nsuch as the Yen or the American Dollar, digital currencies do not require a\nbanking system to move value. With this restriction lifted, working with digital\ncurrencies is much faster than working with banking, especially on a global\nscale. Transferring 10 USD from Osaka to Denver no longer takes days when a\ndigital currency is used. All transactions are made rapidly regardless of the\ndistance.\n\n#### You Own Your Money\n\nAll that a commercial bank account owner is given is a promise of being paid a\ncertain amount of money within a reasonable amount of time after receiving a\npayout request. Banking systems also have limits to any volume of value being\nmoved, rendering an individual unable to withdraw or transfer large amounts\nquickly. In case of cryptocurrencies, the person who holds a special kind of\ninformation called *a secret key* can spend the money at will. No other entity\nhas a power to manipulate the value that a user owns.\n\n#### Pseudonymity\n\nOne can have as many cryptocurrency addresses as they wish, receiving and\nspending money from different addresses as per their purpose. A merchant running\nan E-Commerce shop can have a set of addresses for receiving money and issuing\nrefunds, and a separate personal \"wallet\" for their own needs. A single interface is used\nto control all of these wallets, and there is no need to log in to several\npayment platforms, which makes the process very time-efficient.\n\n#### Security\n\nYour money is as secure as the *secret key* that allows spending it. This means\nthat storing your secret key on a USB flash drive in a safe is equivalent to\nhaving banknotes in a safe. Absolutely nobody can steal this money even by\ncarrying out a successful cyberattack.\n\n#### Extensibility\n\nUsing an approach known as [*side\nchains*](https://www.blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf), general purpose\ncryptocurrencies such as Cardano SL or Bitcoin can enable domain specific\ncryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum Classic. This way, any innovation developed\nvia domain specific cryptocurrency can have participants who hold value in a\ngeneral purpose cryptocurrency. Examples of such applications are identity\nmanagement, gaming and gambling, and verifiable computations.\n\n### What is a Cryptocurrency?\n\nCryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that uses cryptography to\nmanipulate value. Cryptography provides a way to generate proof of genuine\nauthenticity of any kind of information. This is called *digital signing*. In\ncryptocurrencies we generate a ledger (a database which provides information on\nhow much money each address has) by signing and sending transactions to the\nnetwork and receiving blocks of confirmed transactions. Cryptocurrencies are\nnormally decentralized, meaning that many people from all over the globe\nparticipate in ledger generation by running cryptocurrency nodes. Thus, a\nconsensus about the state of the ledger has to be achieved. Two most significant\napproaches for achieving such consensus are discussed in the next section.\n\n## What Makes Cardano SL Special?\n\n<!-- v0.1.0.0 -->\n\nWhile there are similarities between Bitcoin and Cardano SL, there are also many\ndifferences between these two cryptocurrencies. The most significant difference\nis that Bitcoin is a proof of work type cryptocurrency, while Cardano SL makes\nuse of a proof of stake approach to reach consensus. This encourages honesty and\nlong term participation.\n\n### Purpose of a Consensus Algorithm\n\nConsensus algorithms are used to produce new transaction blocks, resulting in an\nupdated state of the ledger. Whenever someone publishes a block of transactions,\nthey — or rather, their node that runs the cryptocurrency protocol — have to\nattach a proof that they have merited it. Below two types of such proofs are\ndiscussed.\n\n### Proof of Work and Mining\n\nProof of work is the most common consensus algorithm type for cryptocurrencies.\nIt originated in Bitcoin, and this is how this cryptocurrency works. To generate\nproof of work, a computer has to solve a challenge. The challenge is a\ncomputationally heavy problem which is hard to solve, but the solution is easy\nto verify. When a computer on a proof of work based network finds a solution, it\npublishes it along with the transactions that the computer has been observing while\ncracking the problem. The owner of this computer collects the transaction fees\nand a reward for generating a block. The entire process is called *mining*.\nMining is very energy consuming, and the amount of energy needed is constantly increasing,\nwhich can lead to unsound competition.\n\n### Proof of Stake and Minting\n\nProof of stake is a novel approach to block generation. IOHK scientists led by\n[Prof. Aggelos Kiayias](https://iohk.io/team/aggelos-kiayias/) have designed the\nfirst provably secure proof of stake algorithm called Ouroboros. Ouroboros lies\nat the heart of Cardano SL. Research team has published a\n[white paper](https://iohk.io/research/papers/a-provably-secure-proof-of-stake-blockchain-protocol/)\nthat is a worthy read for anyone with a background in cryptocurrency theory. The\ncore idea of proof of stake is that instead of wasting electricity on cracking\ncomputationally heavy problems, a node is selected to mint a new block, with a\nprobability proportional to the amount of coins this node has. If a node\nhas positive (&gt; 0) [stake](/cardano/proof-of-stake/#stake), it is called *a\nstakeholder*. If a node eventually becomes chosen to mint a block, it is called *a\nslot leader*. You can read more about this process in [Proof of Stake in Cardano\nSL](/cardano/proof-of-stake/).\n\n<!-- CARDANO_SL_README_BEGIN_2 -->\n## Beyond Settlement Layer\n\nCardano SL is called \"Layer\" for a reason. It is the first component of\nthe Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer,\nserving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special\nkind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out\ncorrectly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for\nverifying honesty of random number generation and game\noutcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish\nsuch tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the\napplication of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity\nmanagement, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform.\nWe are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL [wallet application](https://github.com/input-output-hk/daedalus),\ninto a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated\ncryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.\n<!-- CARDANO_SL_README_END_2 -->\n",

Nonetheless, this section covers the original client to great\nextent, assuming that it will be the initial reference client for some time.\n<!-- end -->\n## High-level overview\n\nA Cardano SL node is a blockchain node. When ran, it finds other nodes (via\n[DHT](http://ast-deim.urv.cat/cpairot/dhts.html)) and then starts performing\nblockchain-related procedures.\n\nTime in Cardano SL is divided into *epochs*. Every epoch is divided into\n*slots*. Epochs and slots are numbered. Therefore, the slot `(3,5)` is read as\n\"the fifth slot of the third epoch\" (the 0-th slot and the 0-th epoch are also\npossible).\n\nCardano SL uses sets of constants, special values defined in\n[the `constants.yaml` configuration file](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/bf5dd592b7bf77a68bf71314718dc7a8d5cc8877/core/constants.yaml).\nThere are two main sets: for production mode and development mode. In this guide\nwe'll refer to productions constants.\n\nSuppose the values for Cardano SL are:\n\n-   slot duration: 120 seconds,\n-   security parameter *k*: 60.\n\nIn other words, **a slot lasts 120 seconds**, and an epoch has [`10×k`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/9ee12d3cc9ca0c8ad95f3031518a4a7acdcffc56/core/Pos/Core/Constants/Raw.hs#L161)\nslots in it, so it lasts **1200 minutes** or **20 hours**.\n\nThere is one node called the slot leader on each slot. Only this node has right\nto generate a new block during this slot; this block will be added to the\nblockchain. However, there's no guarantee that new block will be actually\ngenerated (e.g. slot leader can be offline during a corresponding slot).\n\nFurthermore, slot leader may delegate its right to another node `N`; in this\ncase node `N` will have a right to generate a new block instead of slot leader.\nPlease note that node `N` with delegated right is not called a slot leader\nthough, it is just a delegate.\n\nIt's theoretically possible to delegate the slot leader's right to multiple\nnodes, but it is **not** recommended by reasons explained later. Moreover, we can\nrun multiple nodes with the same key (i.e. on one computer), let's say nodes\n`A`, `B` and `C`, and if node `A` is elected as the slot leader, not only `A`\nitself, but nodes `B` and `C` will be able to generate a new block as well. In\nthis case, every one of these nodes will issue a most probably different block,\nand the network will fork — each other node will accept **only one** of these\nconcurrent blocks. Later, this fork will be eliminated.\n\nDuring the epoch, nodes send each other MPC messages to come to the consensus as\nto who would be allowed to generate blocks in the next epoch. Payloads from\n`Data` messages (along with transactions) are included into blocks.\n\nThe more currency (or \"stake\") an address holds, the more likely it is to be\nchosen to generate a block. Please read about [Ouroboros Proof of Stake Algorithm](/cardano/proof-of-stake/)\nfor more details.\n\nIn short:\n\n1.  send messages,\n2.  receive messages/transactions/etc,\n3.  form a block (if you are the slot leader),\n4.  repeat.\n\n## Business logic\n\n### Listeners\n\nListeners handle incoming messages and respond to them. Various supplemental\nlisteners will not be covered, focusing on the main ones instead.\n\nListeners mostly use the [Relay\nframework](/technical/protocols/csl-application-level/#invreqdata-and-messagepart),\nwhich includes three type of messages:\n\n-   `Inventory` message: node publishes message to network when gets a new data.\n-   `Request` message: node requests a new data which was published in\n    `Inventory` message, from other node, if this data is not known yet by\n    this node.\n-   `Data` message: node replies with this message on `Request` message. `Data`\n    message contains concrete data.\n\nFor instance, when a user creates a new transaction, the wallet sends\n`Inventory` message with transaction id to the network. If the node that has\nreceived `Inventory` doesn't know any transaction with such id, then it replies\nwith `Request` message, after that the wallet sends this transaction in `Data`\nmessage. After the node has received the `Data` message, it can send the\n`Inventory` message to its neighbors in DHT network and repeat previous\niterations again.\n\nAnother example - block listeners [`handleGetHeaders`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/src/Pos/Block/Network/Listeners.hs#L30),\n[`handleGetBlocks`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/src/Pos/Block/Network/Listeners.hs#L50),\n[`handleBlockHeaders`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/src/Pos/Block/Network/Listeners.hs#L77).\n\n### Workers\n\nA Worker is an action repeated with some interval. For example:\n\n-   [`onNewSlotWorker`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/infra/Pos/Communication/Protocol.hs#L218): Runs at the beginning of each slot. Does some cleanup and\n    then runs additional functions. This worker also creates a\n    *genesis block* at the beginning of the epoch. There are two kinds of\n    blocks: \"genesis blocks\" and \"main blocks\". Main blocks are stored in the\n    blockchain; genesis blocks are generated by each node internally between\n    epochs. Genesis blocks aren't announced to other nodes. However, a node may\n    request a genesis block from someone else for convenience, if this node was\n    offline for some time and needs to catch up with the blockchain.\n-   [`blkOnNewSlot`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/d01d392d49db8a25e17749173ec9bce057911191/src/Pos/Block/Worker.hs#L69): Creates\n    a new block (when it is the node's turn to create a new block) and announces it\n    to other nodes.\n\n## Proof of Stake\n\nAt the heart of Cardano SL sits the Ouroboros Proof of Stake protocol, as\ndescribed in [the whitepaper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889) of the same\nname.\n\n## Forks\n\nGenerally, one chain (the *main chain*) is maintained by a node, but eventually\nalternative chains may arise. Recall that only blocks `k` and more slots deep are\nconsidered stable. This way, if a block which is neither a part nor a\ncontinuation of our blockchain is received, we first check if its complexity is\nbigger than ours (the complexity is the length of the chain), and then we start\nsubsequently requesting previous blocks from the node that provided an\nalternative chain header. If we come deeper than `k` slots ago, the alternative\nchain gets rejected. Otherwise, once we get to the block existing in our chain,\nthe alternative chain is added to storage. From the standpoint of state, we\nstore and maintain all the alternative chains that are viable. If it appears\nthat an alternative chain is longer than the main chain, they are swapped,\nmaking the alternative chain the new main chain.\n\n## Supplemental parts\n\n### Slotting\n\nThe consensus scheme we use relies on correct slotting. More specifically, it\nrelies on the assumption that nodes in the system have access to the current\ntime (small deviations are acceptable), which is then used to figure out when\nany particular slot begins and ends, and perform particular actions in this\nslot.\n\nSystem start time is a timestamp of the `(0,0)` slot (i.e. the 0-th slot of the 0-th\nepoch).\n\n## P2P Network\n\n### Peer discovery\n\nWe use Kademlia DHT for peer discovery. It is a general solution for distributed\nhash tables, based on [a whitepaper by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazières,\n2002](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf).\n\nHowever, we only take advantage of its peer discovery mechanism, and use none of\nits hash table capabilities.\n\nIn short, each node in the Kademlia network is provided a `160`-bit id generated\nrandomly. The distance between the nodes is defined by `XOR` metric. The network\nis organized in such a way that node knows no more than `K` (`K=7` in the\noriginal client implementation) nodes for each relative distance range:\n`2^i < d <= 2^(i+1)`.\n\nInitial peer discovery is done by\n[sending](https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/bbdca50c263c6dae251e67eb36a7d4e1ba7c1cb6/src/Network/Kademlia/Implementation.hs#L194)\na Kademlia `FIND_NODE` message with our own node id as a parameter to [a\npre-configured set of\nnodes](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/43a2d079a026b90ba860e79b5be52d1337e26c6f/src/Pos/Constants.hs#L89)\nand the nodes passed by the user on the command line. Our implementation\n[sends](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/43a2d079a026b90ba860e79b5be52d1337e26c6f/infra/Pos/DHT/Real/Real.hs#L228)\nthis request to all known peers at once and then waits for the first reply.\n\nWhile the client runs, it collects peers per Kademlia protocol. The list of\nknown peers is preserved and\n[restored](https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/bbdca50c263c6dae251e67eb36a7d4e1ba7c1cb6/src/Network/Kademlia.hs#L197)\nbetween subsequent launches. For each peer, we keep their [host and port\nnumber](https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/bbdca50c263c6dae251e67eb36a7d4e1ba7c1cb6/src/Network/Kademlia/Types.hs#L42),\nas well as their [node\nid](https://github.com/serokell/kademlia/blob/bbdca50c263c6dae251e67eb36a7d4e1ba7c1cb6/src/Network/Kademlia/Types.hs#L70).\n\n### Messaging\n\nKademlia already provides the notion of nodes that are known. Such nodes can be\ncalled *neighbors*. To send message to all nodes in a network, you can send it\nto neighbors, they will resend it to their neighbors, and so on. But sometimes\nwe may need to not propagate messages across all network, but send it to\nneighbors only. Hence we have three types of sending messages:\n\n-   send to a node,\n-   send to neighbors,\n-   send to network.\n\n#### Message types\n\nTo handle this, three kind of message headers are used, and there are two\nmessage types:\n\n-   Simple: sending to a single peer.\n-   Broadcast: attempting to send to the entire network, iteratively sending\n    messages to neighbors.\n\nBroadcast messages are resent to neighbors right after retrieval (before\nhandling). Also, they are being checked against LRU cache, and messages that\nhave been already received once get ignored.\n\n### Leaders and rich men computation (LRC)\n\n\"Slot leaders\" and \"rich men\" are two important notions of Ouroboros Proof of\nStake Algorithm.\n\n-   Slot leaders: Slot leaders for the current epoch (for each slot of the\n    current epoch) are computed by [Follow the\n    Satoshi](/cardano/proof-of-stake/#follow-the-satoshi) (FTS) algorithm in the\n    beginning of current epoch. FTS uses a `shared seed` which is result of\n    [Multi Party Computation](/cardano/proof-of-stake/#multi-party-computation)\n    (MPC) algorithm for previous epoch: in the result of MPC some nodes reveal\n    their seeds, `xor` of these seeds is called `shared seed`.\n\n-   Rich men: Only nodes that have sent their VSS certificates and also have\n    enough stake can participate in the MPC algorithm. So in the beginning of\n    epoch node must know all potential participants for validation of MPC\n    messages during this epoch. Rich men are also computed in the beginning of\n    current epoch.\n\nRich men are important for other components as well; for instance, Update system\nuses rich men for checking that node can publish update proposal and vote.\n\nThere are two ways of computing who the rich men will be: - considering common\nstake - considering delegated stake (Ouroboros provides opportunity to delegate\nown stake to other node, see more in [Delegation\nsection](/cardano/differences/#stake-delegation))\n\nMPC and Update System components need rich men with delegated stake, but\nDelegation component with common stake.\n\n## Constants\n\nCardano SL uses a list of the fundamental constants.

Nonetheless, this section covers the original client to great\nextent, assuming that it will be the initial reference client for some time.\n<!-- end -->\n## High-level overview\n\nA Cardano SL node is a blockchain node. When ran, it finds other nodes (via\n[DHT](http://ast-deim.urv.cat/cpairot/dhts.html)) and then starts performing\nblockchain-related procedures.\n\nTime in Cardano SL is divided into *epochs*. Every epoch is divided into\n*slots*. Epochs and slots are numbered. Therefore, the slot `(3,5)` is read as\n\"the fifth slot of the third epoch\" (the 0-th slot and the 0-th epoch are also\npossible).\n\nCardano SL uses sets of constants, special values defined in\n[the `constants.yaml` configuration file](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/bf5dd592b7bf77a68bf71314718dc7a8d5cc8877/core/constants.yaml).\nThere are two main sets: for production mode and development mode. In this guide\nwe'll refer to productions constants.\n\nSuppose the values for Cardano SL are:\n\n-   slot duration: 120 seconds,\n-   security parameter *k*: 60.\n\nIn other words, **a slot lasts 120 seconds**, and an epoch has [`10×k`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/9ee12d3cc9ca0c8ad95f3031518a4a7acdcffc56/core/Pos/Core/Constants/Raw.hs#L161)\nslots in it, so it lasts **1200 minutes** or **20 hours**.\n\nThere is one node called the slot leader on each slot. Only this node has right\nto generate a new block during this slot; this block will be added to the\nblockchain. However, there's no guarantee that new block will be actually\ngenerated (e.g. slot leader can be offline during a corresponding slot).\n\nFurthermore, slot leader may delegate its right to another node `N`; in this\ncase node `N` will have a right to generate a new block instead of slot leader.\nPlease note that node `N` with delegated right is not called a slot leader\nthough, it is just a delegate.\n\nIt's theoretically possible to delegate the slot leader's right to multiple\nnodes, but it is **not** recommended by reasons explained later. Moreover, we can\nrun multiple nodes with the same key (i.e. on one computer), let's say nodes\n`A`, `B` and `C`, and if node `A` is elected as the slot leader, not only `A`\nitself, but nodes `B` and `C` will be able to generate a new block as well. In\nthis case, every one of these nodes will issue a most probably different block,\nand the network will fork — each other node will accept **only one** of these\nconcurrent blocks. Later, this fork will be eliminated.\n\nDuring the epoch, nodes send each other MPC messages to come to the consensus as\nto who would be allowed to generate blocks in the next epoch. Payloads from\n`Data` messages (along with transactions) are included into blocks.\n\nThe more currency (or \"stake\") an address holds, the more likely it is to be\nchosen to generate a block. Please read about [Ouroboros Proof of Stake Algorithm](/cardano/proof-of-stake/)\nfor more details.\n\nIn short:\n\n1.  send messages,\n2.  receive messages/transactions/etc,\n3.  form a block (if you are the slot leader),\n4.  repeat.\n\n## Business logic\n\n### Listeners\n\nListeners handle incoming messages and respond to them. Various supplemental\nlisteners will not be covered, focusing on the main ones instead.\n\nListeners mostly use the [Relay\nframework](/technical/protocols/csl-application-level/#invreqdata-and-messagepart),\nwhich includes three type of messages:\n\n-   `Inventory` message: node publishes message to network when gets a new data.\n-   `Request` message: node requests a new data which was published in\n    `Inventory` message, from other node, if this data is not known yet by\n    this node.\n-   `Data` message: node replies with this message on `Request` message. `Data`\n    message contains concrete data.\n\nFor instance, when a user creates a new transaction, the wallet sends\n`Inventory` message with transaction id to the network. If the node that has\nreceived `Inventory` doesn't know any transaction with such id, then it replies\nwith `Request` message, after that the wallet sends this transaction in `Data`\nmessage. After the node has received the `Data` message, it can send the\n`Inventory` message to its neighbors in DHT network and repeat previous\niterations again.\n\nAnother example - block listeners [`handleGetHeaders`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/src/Pos/Block/Network/Listeners.hs#L30),\n[`handleGetBlocks`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/src/Pos/Block/Network/Listeners.hs#L50),\n[`handleBlockHeaders`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/69e896143cb02612514352e286403852264f0ba3/src/Pos/Block/Network/Listeners.hs#L77).\n\n### Workers\n\nA Worker is an action repeated with some interval.

Running the bitcoin protocol is a very expensive endeavor which uses\nlarge amounts of energy. It is estimated that 3.8 American households can be powered\nfor a day by the energy that is spent to generate one bitcoin transaction. These energy\nrequirements for running the bitcoin protocol continue to grow as more and more bitcoin\nminers sink money into mining. In addition, more energy is needed as the difficulty\nof the problems that their computers or mining rigs, encounter increases. This is why\nresearchers have investigated alternative ways to reach consensus — such as using the\nso-called BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant), consensus algorithms and PoS algorithms.\n\n## What is Proof of Stake?\n\nProof of Stake is a novel approach to block generation. The core idea of Proof of Stake\nis that instead of wasting electricity on cracking computationally heavy problems, a node\nis selected to generate (or “mint”) a new block with a probability proportional to the\namount of coins this node has. If a node has positive (> 0) stake, it is called a “stakeholder”.\nIf a node eventually becomes chosen to mint a new block, it is called a “slot leader”.\n<!-- end -->\n### Proof\n\nThe “proof” part of “proof of stake” refers to evidence that blocks of\ntransactions are legitimate.\n\n### Stake\n\nWhile “stake” means “the relative value held by addresses on the node”. By “relative\nvalue” we mean “all the total value held by wallets on a particular node divided by\nthe total value in the Cardano SL system”. For more information, please see:\n[Balance and Stake in Cardano SL](/cardano/balance-and-stake/)\n\n## About Slot Leaders\n\nNodes with a positive stake are called stakeholders, and only stakeholders may\nparticipate in running the protocol. Moreover, to be able to generate new blocks\nfor the blockchain, a stakeholder must be elected as a slot leader. The slot leader can\nlisten to transactions announced by other nodes, make a block of those transactions,\nsign this block with its secret key and publish it to the network.\n\nYou can think of a slot leader as a miner in bitcoin, but the above-mentioned consensus\ndefines who will be able to mine, when and how much.\n\n## Epochs and Slots\n\nThe Ouroboros protocol divides the physical time into **epochs**, and each epoch is\ndivided into **slots**. For example:\n\n```\n+----------+----------+-------+----------+--------------------> t\n|  slot 0  |  slot 1  |  ...  |  slot N  |\n\n \\                                      / \\\n  -------------- epoch M ---------------   -- epoch M+1 -- ...\n```\n\n**Note:** a slot is a relatively short period of time (for example, 20 seconds).\n\nEach slot has one and only one leader (slot leader, SL):\n\n```\n+----------+----------+-------+----------+----> t\n|  slot 0  |  slot 1  |  ...  |  slot N  |\n\n    SL 0       SL 1               SL N\n```\n\nThe slot leader has a (sole) right to produce one and only one block during his slot:\n\n```\n  +------+   +------+           +------+\n  | Bl 0 |<--| Bl 1 |<-- ... <--| Bl N |\n  +------+   +------+           +------+\n+----------+----------+-------+----------+----> t\n|  slot 0  |  slot 1  |  ...  |  slot N  |\n\n    SL 0       SL 1               SL N\n```\n\nIt means that the number of slot leaders is strictly equal to the number of slots\nin epoch (let's call this number `N`), so it is impossible to produce more than `N`\nblocks during an epoch.\n\nIf slot leader missed their slot (for example, when offline), the right to produce\na block is lost until they are elected again.\n\n**Note:** One or more slots can remain empty (without generated blocks), but the\nmajority of blocks (at least 50% + 1) **must** be generated during an epoch.\n\n## How Slot Leaders Elections Work\n\nSlot leaders are elected from the group of all stakeholders. Please note that not all\nstakeholders participate in this election, but only ones who have enough stake (for example, 2% of\nthe total stake). This group of stakeholders are known as “electors”.\n\nElectors elect slot leaders for the next epoch during the current epoch. Thus, at the end of epoch\n`N` it is already known who are slot leaders for the epoch `N+1`, and it cannot be\nchanged.\n\nYou can think of this election as a “fair lottery”; anyone from the group of stakeholders can\nbecome a slot leader. However, an important idea of PoS is that the more stake stakeholder has,\nthe more chances one has to be elected as a slot leader. \n\n**Note:** One stakeholder can be elected as a slot leader for more than one slot\nduring the same epoch.\n\n### Multiparty Computation\n\nOne of the fundamental problems of the slot leader election process is its unbiasedness.\nA certain degree of randomness is needed as a base for election, in this case, results of\nthis election are random and fair. So the question is where can this randomness be obtained\nfrom?\n\nA multiparty computation (MPC) approach is used to achieve this randomness where each elector\nindependently performs an action which is called “coin tossing” and after that shares results\nwith other electors. The idea is that results are randomly generated by each elector, but eventually\nthey agree on the same final value.\n\n#### Commitment Phase\n\nFirst of all, an elector generates a secret (or special random value). Next, an elector forms a\n“commitment” which is a message that contains encrypted shares (see an explanation below) and\nproof of secret.\n\nThe next step is when an elector signs this commitment with its secret key, specifies the epoch's\nnumber and attaches its public key. In this case, everybody can check who created this commitment\nand which epoch this commitment relates to.\n\nSubsequently, an elector sends its commitment to other electors, so eventually each elector collects\ncommitments from all other electors.\n\n**Note:** these commitments are put into the block, that is, they become a part of the blockchain.\n\n#### Reveal Phase\n\nThe reveal phase is where an elector sends an “opening”, or special value for opening a commitment.\nA commitment is like a locked box (with a secret in it), and the act of opening involves a key that\nopens the box retrieves the secret.\n\n**Note:** all openings are put into the block, that is, they become a part of the blockchain.\n\n#### Recovery Phase\n\nThe final phase in the process is called the recovery phase.\n\nEventually, an elector has both commitments and openings. Theoretically some electors can be an\nadversary and can publish its commitment but **not** publish its opening.\n\nIn this case, the honest electors can post all shares (mentioned above) to reconstruct the\nsecret. The idea is simple: an election finishes successfully even if some electors are adversaries.\n\nSubsequently, an elector verifies that commitments and openings match, and if so, extracts the\nsecrets from the commitments and forms a seed (randomly generated byte string) from these secrets.\nSo all electors get the same seed, and it will be used for Follow the Satoshi (FTS) algorithm.\n\n### Follow the Satoshi\n\nAt this moment, electors have the seed (randomness we need). Now they have to select a particular slot\nleaders for the next epoch. This is where the Follow the Satoshi (FTS) algorithm comes into effect:\n\n```\n         +-----+\nSEED --->| FTS |---> ELECTED_SLOT_LEADERS\n         +-----+\n```\n\nTo explain how a slot leader gets selected, think of the smallest, atomic piece\nof value as a coin called “[Lovelace](/glossary/#lovelace)”. Fundamentally, the ledger produces the\ndistribution of coins, and since slot leaders can only be selected from stakeholders distribution of\nstake. FTS is an algorithm that verifiably picks a coin, and when coin owned by stakeholder `S` selected,\n`S` become a slot leader. It is clear that the more coins `S` has, the higher the probability that one\nof his coins will be picked.\n\nThe reason why it is called “Follow the Satoshi” is that in bitcoin, an atomic piece of currency\nis called “Satoshi”, honoring Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin. \n\n## Honest Majority\n\nThe fundamental assumption of a protocol is known as **honest majority**. This means that\nparticipants owning at least 50% + 1 of the total stake are honest ones. In this\ncase we can **prove** that adversaries cannot break _persistence_ and _liveness_\nof the blockchain. For more information see the [paper](/glossary/#paper) (pages 2 and 3).\n",

Thus, when the user *Alice* sends money to the user *Bob*, the new\ntransaction emerges. Let's call this transaction `Tx1`, the node under *Alice*'\nwallet `N1`, and the node under *Bob*'s wallet `N2`.\n\nThus, the node `N1` does the following steps:\n\n1.  Creating transaction `Tx1` and signs it with its private key.\n2.  Sending it to all known nodes (i.e. neighbors).\n3.  Saving it in its local data.\n\nEach of `N1`'s neighbors sends `Tx1` transaction to its neighbors and so on, and\nsome slot leader will store this transaction in some block in the ledger. Please\nnote that if the network is under high load, it may take a lot of time for\ntransaction to be actually added to the block.\n<!-- end -->\n## Design\n\nEach transaction contains a list of *inputs* and a list of *outputs*; outputs of\nthe transaction `Tx0` can be used as inputs of the other transaction `Tx1`, and\nso on:\n\n                Tx0                           Tx1\n      +----------------------+      +----------------------+\n      |                      |      |                      |\n      |  Inputs     Outputs  |      |  Inputs     Outputs  |\n      | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |\n      | | In0  |   | Out0  + |      | | In0  |   | Out0  | |\n      | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |\n      | | In1  |   | Out1  | |      | | In1  |   | Out1  | |\n      | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |\n      | | ...  |   | ...   | |      | | ..   |   | ...   | |\n      | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |\n      | | InN  |   | OutM  | |      | | InN  |   | OutM  | |\n      | +------+   +-------+ |      | +------+   +-------+ |\n      |                      |      |                      |\n      +----------------------+      +----------------------+     ...\n\nInputs and outputs carry information about *money flow*: inputs inform where the\nmoney came from, and outputs inform where the money comes to. Please notice that\nthere's `N` and `M`, because the actual number of inputs and outputs can be\ndifferent.\n\nThus, each input contains:\n\n1.  An ID of transaction `TxN`, whose output is used for this input. Transaction\n    ID is a BLAKE2b-256 hash of the transaction, something like\n    `f9bcbe752aee4512457f1fd350200cf870906b7e6e836688c9a3779645c86c01`.\n2.

We want to send 100 ADA from the current node with address `a00e4bb2..` to\n    the node with address `88ca7f79..`.\n2.  This money corresponds to `0`th output of the previous transaction with an\n    ID `891971a4c..`.\n\n## Verification\n\nAs mentioned above, the transaction's output becomes the input of the other\ntransaction. In this case, we treat such output as *spent transaction output*.\nThus, an output `Out0` of the transaction `891971a4cc31e32..` is a spent output,\nbecause it already is an input of the `f9bcbe752aee4512..` transaction.\n\nBut such spendings do not occur immediately, so an output that *isn't yet* an\ninput of another transaction is called an *unspent transaction output*. Only\nunspent outputs can be used as inputs for other transactions, to prevent\n[double-spending](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending).\n\nSo every node in the network not only accepts transactions, but also\nverifies them. To do it, every node has to keep track of unspent outputs, it\nallows to validate that inputs in a published transaction are indeed the unspent\noutputs. Actually, all unspent outputs called *utxo*, and this is a part of the\nspecial key-value database called *Global State*.\n\n## Proofs of Transaction Legitimacy\n\nEach transaction in Cardano SL is accompanied by a proof (also called a **witness**)\nthat this transaction is legitimate. Even if the output is an unspent one, we\nhave to prove that we have *a right* to spend it. Since a `TxN` transaction can\nhave many inputs, the witness for it consists of the witnesses of all `TxN`'s\ninputs, and only if all the inputs are legitimate, `TxN` is legitimate too. If a\nparticular transaction isn't legitimate, it will be rejected by the network.\n\nBecause of [two available types of node\naddress](/cardano/addresses/#what-does-an-address-look-like) we use two\ncorresponding versions of the witness: based on *public key* and based on\n*script*.\n\nFor example, the first option works with a public key `PK` and a transaction\nsignature: legitimate input must be signed with a private key corresponding to `PK`.\nSo it's possible to check this signature and either accept that input or reject it.\n\nWitnesses are stored in the blockchain and anybody can see, inspect and\nindependently verify them. But after some time a node may delete old proofs in\norder to save space. The technique of storing transactions separately from their\nproofs is called \"segregated witness\" (you may have heard of it being recently\n[implemented in\nBitcoin](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/)). Under this\nscheme, transactions and proofs are stored in two separate places in a block,\nand can be processed independently.\n\n## Stake Distribution\n\nStake distribution is another part of Cardano SL, not directly related to delegation,\nbut one we can exploit for its benefit.\n\nSome addresses have multiple owners, which poses a problem of stake computation as per\nFollow-the-Satoshi each coin should only be counted once towards each stakeholder's stake total.\nUnlike balance (real amount of coins on the balance), stake gives user power to control different\nalgorithm parts: being the slot leader, voting in Update system, taking part in MPC/SSC.\n\nStake distribution is a value associated with each address. Technically stake distribution is a value\nwhich is a part of address' attributes. This value corresponds to one of three different cases:\n\n1.  Bootstrap era distribution. This is a special value which is mandatory in Bootstrap era, but it can be used\n    after Bootstrap era as well.\n2.  Single key distribution, which means that all stake will go to the given stakeholder.\n    In this case distribution contains stakeholder's identifier.\n3.  Multiple key distribution, which means that stake will go to the multiple stakeholders (at least two).\n    In this case distribution contains pairs \"stakeholder's identifier - portion of an output\".\n    Transaction's output has a value, portion of this value is a stake.\n\nStake distributions are considered by both [slot-leader election process](https://cardanodocs.com/technical/leader-selection/)\nand Richmen Computations.\n\nThis feature can be used in similar way to [delegation](https://cardanodocs.com/technical/delegation/), but there\nare differences:\n\n1.  There is no certificate(s): to revoke stake delegation `A` has to move funds, providing\n    different stake distribution.\n2.  The portion of `A`'s stake can be delegated via distribution. On the contrary, delegation\n    requires you to delegate all funds of whole address at once.\n",

Transaction\n    ID is a BLAKE2b-256 hash of the transaction, something like\n    `f9bcbe752aee4512457f1fd350200cf870906b7e6e836688c9a3779645c86c01`.\n2.

It introduces some overhead to blockchain processing, but has\nseveral important benefits:\n\n1.  For each client implementing the protocol, its latest version from\n    blockchain is known.\n2.  There is no central entity responsible for maintaining or distributing\n    updates, any such update is proposed under implicit or explicit agreement of\n    the majority of stake and then distributed in a decentralized way.\n3.  We do not rely upon clients updating the software on their PCs in time; this\n    is done automatically, and updates are announced directly via the\n    blockchain.\n4.  If any security flaws are detected in some version of the CSL protocol or in\n    some particular implementation, there would be a mechanism to distribute an\n    update rapidly (and still under agreement of the majority of stake).\n\n## Application Update: Sign and Announce\n\nHere we consider ways to update the application securely. Protocol updates are a\nseparate issue which is covered in the relevant section of this document.\n\nFor an update to be applied, its proposal needs be approved first. Update\nproposal can be approved if at least one of two agreements is reached:\n\n1.  **Explicit agreement**: it has positive votes from majority of total stake\n    (i. e. strictly greater than `50%`).\n2.  **Implicit agreement**: it has positive votes from more stake than negative\n    votes ﻿⁠⁠⁠and﻿⁠⁠⁠ it has been in blockchain for at least `U` slots.\n\nThis approach seems to fit naturally into the CSL model, as in a PoS\ncryptocurrency every stakeholder is responsible for maintaining the system\nproportionally to the relative size of their stake, and the blockchain is\nmaintained via consensus among stakeholders.\n\nSoftware updates are a part of this maintenance process too, so the stakeholders\nshould agree on whether to consider this update trusted.\n\n### Implicit Agreement\n\nThe fact that stakeholders are responsible for system updates does not restrict\nus to a system where every single update requires a signature from the majority\nof stake. We can introduce the concept of an **implicit agreement**.\n\nAn update has to have at least minimal bound (`updateProposalThd` in \n[configuration.yaml](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/e26ad11397c87ce8b00f2a26d5e237f54d6ea90a/lib/configuration.yaml).) \nof the stake signatures to be published on\nthe blockchain. It is not enough for stakeholders to sign the update — they\nshould vote either for or against it.\n\n### Incorporation of Alternative Clients\n\nIOHK will maintain a single official client. But there is also room for\nthird-party alternative clients maintained by the community. One requires enough\ncollected signatures from stakeholders to publish their system update, which may\nbe not an «update», but a different client developed from scratch, or a fork of\nthe official client. As long as this update has enough signatures from\nstakeholders, the network considers it trusted, and it is updated via the same\nmechanisms as the official client.\n\n## Application Update: Deliver and Apply\n\nА list of HTTP mirrors ran by IOHK shall be sufficient for a start.\n\nIn process of time, we plan to maintain a Bittorrent-based or Bittorrent-like\nsolution to distribute updates. In general, P2P update distribution is a crucial\nbusiness requirement due to legal concerns. It is to be decided which\nBittorrent-like solution particular we will use.\n\nAlso, it’s interesting to note that the update itself does not require a secure\nand trusted channel to be used for delivery, as it is signed with some known in\nadvance and trusted key (or set of keys).\n\nApplication updates are prepared with\n[bsdiff](https://github.com/mendsley/bsdiff) and applied either directly or via\nan installer. We're considering migrating to\n[courgette](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/software-updates-courgette)\nin the future.\n\n## Protocol Update\n\nFirst, we need to distinguish hard and soft protocol updates.\n\nA soft fork proposes modifying blockchain consensus rules so that the new\nversion blocks are still compatible with old version clients. A hard fork is one\nthat doesn’t maintain backward compatibility with the previous version.\n\n[BIP-99](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/ed283b05b332b85b6fd683be3a5d73fab6c15554/bip-0099.mediawiki)\nprovides excellent criteria to distinguish between these two fork types:\n\n-   A **soft fork** introduces new rules, or restrictions, on blocks. That way,\n    everything that was previously invalid remains invalid, while some blocks\n    that would have been previously considered valid become invalid.\n-   A **hard fork** is a fork that makes previously invalid blocks valid.\n\nSoft forks have some deployment advantages like backward compatibility, and they\ndon't require everyone's consensus, as the stake majority of users can impose\nthe new rules. By contrast, hard forks require all users to upgrade.\n\nIn theory, a hard fork may lead to a situation when a network splits into two\nparts, each maintaining a separate chain: one from the nodes that adopted the\nlatest system update, and another from the nodes that rejected to do that. This\nmeans some blocks from the first part are considered invalid by the other part,\nand vice versa.\n\nWe define **protocol version** as a tuple `(Maj, Min, Alt)`:\n\n-   Major version (2 bytes): to be changed rarely, changes are not\n    backward-compatible and would produce a hard fork.\n-   Minor version (2 bytes): integer to be adjusted for each update.\n    -   Changes should be backward-compatible in a sense that a block generated\n        by the new version shall be somehow accepted by old version.\n    -   A particular block may contain addresses of unknown type. For each case\n        like this, a concise workaround should be found in order not to affect\n        stability and correctness of the system.\n-   Alt version (1 byte): integer to manage several simultaneous protocol update\n    proposals.\n\nThe protocol version is to be announced in the application update, and is to be\nput later into each block created by updated software.\n\nA major version change triggers a hard fork in the future.\n\nA minor version change notifies the network that the subsequent application\nupdate modifies the protocol managed by a soft fork.\n\nAlt version is a marker of new features. It allows independent developers to\nintroduce multiple changes to the protocol simultaneously. For example, if one\nvendor decides to introduce feature X via a soft fork, and another proposes\nfeature Y (also via a soft fork), their software will be issuing blocks with\nversions `a.b.X` and `a.b.Y`, which can coexist in the blockchain. However, only\none will eventually be adopted.\n\n## Soft Fork Updates\n\nThere is a thin line between what we can do within a soft fork and what we\ncannot:\n\n1.  An old version of the client should always find recent blocks valid. (This\n    is what\n    [BIP-99](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/ed283b05b332b85b6fd683be3a5d73fab6c15554/bip-0099.mediawiki)\n    calls \"everything invalid remains invalid\").\n2.  Some blocks issued by an old version of the client may be considered invalid\n    by a newer version.\n\nObviously, imposing rule 2 as it is may cause the network to be split into two\nparts: a stakeholder with a stake large enough could update and maintain their\nown chain, rejecting blocks from others, but others would be still able to\nmaintain their chain, rejecting blocks from this stakeholder (since he does not\nhave a majority of stake, and therefore cannot catch up with the rest of the\ncrowd, so his chain is shorter). A simple resolution rule could go like this: if\n95% of the latest 2016 blocks have a newer block version, the blocks with the\nolder version are rejected.\n\n**NOTE**: **block version** here and later has the same meaning as the\n**protocol version**.\n\nIt may seem unclear why we would like to make some block version invalid at some\nmoment. The key insight here is that a new feature is actually a restriction on\nwhat we had had previously. For example, currently we have plain old\ntransactions which may contain either PublicKey-based addresses or Script-based\nones. Then at some point we decide to include a third address type (no matter\nwhat its purpose is). Which strategy do we need for verifying a block with a\ntransaction with an address of unknown type? Obviously the only option is not\nverifying this address.\n\nThen imagine somebody proposing a transaction to this address, possibly doing\nthat with an intention to secure funds from being spent until some conditions\nare met — and then watching them being spent in some other transaction in a\nblock with version 1. This is the point. We cannot make use of a restriction\nwithout waiting for the network to start assuming the old version to be\ndeprecated (since we can only start rejecting blocks when their version is\ndeprecated).\n\nWe also cannot bluntly accept all blocks with a version that is higher than the\none currently adopted, since in our implementation every block has a special field\nwhich is used for storing auxiliary information. An attacker can claim she uses a\nhigher version of the protocol and generate a block whose `attributes` are polluted\nwith meaningless keys. If we accept it, it will bloat the blockchain.\n\nThis is the motivation for the logic described below.\n\nIn our implementation, a block version can exist in the following states:\n\n-   **Adopted**, when the soft fork resolution rule (see below) for a confirmed\n    block version is triggered.\n-   **Confirmed**, when there is an update proposal that contains a confirmed\n    version of the software and this block version. Note that \"confirmed version\n    of the software\" is a technical term defined\n    [elsewhere](/cardano/update-mechanism/#soft-fork-updates). If there are\n    multiple block versions where corresponding software is confirmed, but these\n    versions aren't adopted, we call them **competing**. For instance, there\n    might be versions `2.0.0`, `2.0.1`, `1.2.0`, `1.2.1`, `1.1.1` and `1.1.2`,\n    with the last adopted version being `1.1.3`. In this case the versions that\n    are competing are `2.0.0`, `2.0.1`, `1.2.0` and `1.2.1`. The older versions\n    `1.1.1` and `1.1.2` aren't competing, because `1.1.3` is already adopted.\n-   Everything else. For example, a new block version is proposed, but the\n    software version isn't confirmed yet. There is no special name for this\n    state.\n\nThe soft fork resolution rule works as follows:\n\n-   Informally, a block version becomes *adopted* when a certain percentage of\n    stake (75% in the current implementation, but this may be different in the\n    mainnet) creates a block with version `X`.\n-   Formally, we do the following. First, recall that by design, our system does\n    not allow rollbacks of blockchain deeper than a certain fixed global\n    threshold `k`, which allows to define *stable* stake for each stakeholder as\n    their stake `k` blocks ago. When we process genesis block for epoch `e`, we\n    compute the stable stake of all leaders of all slots from the very beginning\n    of the network's existence. For each block with version `X` that is\n    currently *competing*, we take all created *stable* blocks with version `X`,\n    take set of all leaders of these blocks and accumulate their stakes. If one\n    of versions has ≥ 75%, it gets *adopted*. If more than one version has ≥\n    75%, we take one of them deterministically.\n\nNote that adopted block version can't be changed during epoch (only between\nepochs), so all blocks in an epoch are verified according to the same rules\n(because rules are defined by adopted block version). But it's wrong to assume\nthat *all* blocks in an epoch have the same block version. After block version\nis adopted, another block version can become competing and some nodes may create\nblocks with this new version.\n\nSo, gathering everything up:\n\n1.  Once the update is confirmed, the protocol version (say `0.5.0`) can be\n    used.\n2.  Behavior of nodes that *have* been updated (i.e. can issue and validate\n    blocks with the newer version):\n    1.  Before the soft fork is resolved (i.e. before the resolution rule is\n        triggered), issue blocks with the new version `0.5.0`, but do not\n        include any new `attributes` (if there are any). Treat and validate\n        blocks of version `0.5.0` as blocks of version `0.4.0`.\n    2.  Once the soft fork is resolved, issue and validate blocks per version\n        `0.5.0`, including the new `attributes`.\n3.  Behavior of nodes that *have not* been updated (i.e. cannot issue and\n    validate blocks with the newer version):\n    1.  Before the soft fork is resolved, issue and validate blocks per version\n        `0.4.0`. Among other things, a block is not accepted if it contains\n        unknown `attributes`.\n    2.  Once the soft fork is resolved, start accepting all blocks with version\n        `0.5.0`, including the ones with unknown `attributes`. Keep validating\n        them as version `0.4.0`.\n\n## Hard Fork Updates\n\nHard forks are resolved using modified proof of burn.

It introduces some overhead to blockchain processing, but has\nseveral important benefits:\n\n1.  For each client implementing the protocol, its latest version from\n    blockchain is known.\n2.  There is no central entity responsible for maintaining or distributing\n    updates, any such update is proposed under implicit or explicit agreement of\n    the majority of stake and then distributed in a decentralized way.\n3.  We do not rely upon clients updating the software on their PCs in time; this\n    is done automatically, and updates are announced directly via the\n    blockchain.\n4.  If any security flaws are detected in some version of the CSL protocol or in\n    some particular implementation, there would be a mechanism to distribute an\n    update rapidly (and still under agreement of the majority of stake).\n\n## Application Update: Sign and Announce\n\nHere we consider ways to update the application securely. Protocol updates are a\nseparate issue which is covered in the relevant section of this document.\n\nFor an update to be applied, its proposal needs be approved first. Update\nproposal can be approved if at least one of two agreements is reached:\n\n1.  **Explicit agreement**: it has positive votes from majority of total stake\n    (i. e. strictly greater than `50%`).\n2.  **Implicit agreement**: it has positive votes from more stake than negative\n    votes ﻿⁠⁠⁠and﻿⁠⁠⁠ it has been in blockchain for at least `U` slots.\n\nThis approach seems to fit naturally into the CSL model, as in a PoS\ncryptocurrency every stakeholder is responsible for maintaining the system\nproportionally to the relative size of their stake, and the blockchain is\nmaintained via consensus among stakeholders.\n\nSoftware updates are a part of this maintenance process too, so the stakeholders\nshould agree on whether to consider this update trusted.\n\n### Implicit Agreement\n\nThe fact that stakeholders are responsible for system updates does not restrict\nus to a system where every single update requires a signature from the majority\nof stake. We can introduce the concept of an **implicit agreement**.\n\nAn update has to have at least minimal bound (`updateProposalThd` in \n[configuration.yaml](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/e26ad11397c87ce8b00f2a26d5e237f54d6ea90a/lib/configuration.yaml).) \nof the stake signatures to be published on\nthe blockchain. It is not enough for stakeholders to sign the update — they\nshould vote either for or against it.\n\n### Incorporation of Alternative Clients\n\nIOHK will maintain a single official client. But there is also room for\nthird-party alternative clients maintained by the community. One requires enough\ncollected signatures from stakeholders to publish their system update, which may\nbe not an «update», but a different client developed from scratch, or a fork of\nthe official client. As long as this update has enough signatures from\nstakeholders, the network considers it trusted, and it is updated via the same\nmechanisms as the official client.\n\n## Application Update: Deliver and Apply\n\nА list of HTTP mirrors ran by IOHK shall be sufficient for a start.\n\nIn process of time, we plan to maintain a Bittorrent-based or Bittorrent-like\nsolution to distribute updates. In general, P2P update distribution is a crucial\nbusiness requirement due to legal concerns. It is to be decided which\nBittorrent-like solution particular we will use.\n\nAlso, it’s interesting to note that the update itself does not require a secure\nand trusted channel to be used for delivery, as it is signed with some known in\nadvance and trusted key (or set of keys).\n\nApplication updates are prepared with\n[bsdiff](https://github.com/mendsley/bsdiff) and applied either directly or via\nan installer. We're considering migrating to\n[courgette](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/software-updates-courgette)\nin the future.\n\n## Protocol Update\n\nFirst, we need to distinguish hard and soft protocol updates.\n\nA soft fork proposes modifying blockchain consensus rules so that the new\nversion blocks are still compatible with old version clients. A hard fork is one\nthat doesn’t maintain backward compatibility with the previous version.\n\n[BIP-99](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/ed283b05b332b85b6fd683be3a5d73fab6c15554/bip-0099.mediawiki)\nprovides excellent criteria to distinguish between these two fork types:\n\n-   A **soft fork** introduces new rules, or restrictions, on blocks. That way,\n    everything that was previously invalid remains invalid, while some blocks\n    that would have been previously considered valid become invalid.\n-   A **hard fork** is a fork that makes previously invalid blocks valid.\n\nSoft forks have some deployment advantages like backward compatibility, and they\ndon't require everyone's consensus, as the stake majority of users can impose\nthe new rules. By contrast, hard forks require all users to upgrade.\n\nIn theory, a hard fork may lead to a situation when a network splits into two\nparts, each maintaining a separate chain: one from the nodes that adopted the\nlatest system update, and another from the nodes that rejected to do that. This\nmeans some blocks from the first part are considered invalid by the other part,\nand vice versa.\n\nWe define **protocol version** as a tuple `(Maj, Min, Alt)`:\n\n-   Major version (2 bytes): to be changed rarely, changes are not\n    backward-compatible and would produce a hard fork.\n-   Minor version (2 bytes): integer to be adjusted for each update.\n    -   Changes should be backward-compatible in a sense that a block generated\n        by the new version shall be somehow accepted by old version.\n    -   A particular block may contain addresses of unknown type. For each case\n        like this, a concise workaround should be found in order not to affect\n        stability and correctness of the system.\n-   Alt version (1 byte): integer to manage several simultaneous protocol update\n    proposals.\n\nThe protocol version is to be announced in the application update, and is to be\nput later into each block created by updated software.\n\nA major version change triggers a hard fork in the future.\n\nA minor version change notifies the network that the subsequent application\nupdate modifies the protocol managed by a soft fork.\n\nAlt version is a marker of new features. It allows independent developers to\nintroduce multiple changes to the protocol simultaneously. For example, if one\nvendor decides to introduce feature X via a soft fork, and another proposes\nfeature Y (also via a soft fork), their software will be issuing blocks with\nversions `a.b.X` and `a.b.Y`, which can coexist in the blockchain. However, only\none will eventually be adopted.\n\n## Soft Fork Updates\n\nThere is a thin line between what we can do within a soft fork and what we\ncannot:\n\n1.  An old version of the client should always find recent blocks valid. (This\n    is what\n    [BIP-99](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/ed283b05b332b85b6fd683be3a5d73fab6c15554/bip-0099.mediawiki)\n    calls \"everything invalid remains invalid\").\n2.  Some blocks issued by an old version of the client may be considered invalid\n    by a newer version.\n\nObviously, imposing rule 2 as it is may cause the network to be split into two\nparts: a stakeholder with a stake large enough could update and maintain their\nown chain, rejecting blocks from others, but others would be still able to\nmaintain their chain, rejecting blocks from this stakeholder (since he does not\nhave a majority of stake, and therefore cannot catch up with the rest of the\ncrowd, so his chain is shorter). A simple resolution rule could go like this: if\n95% of the latest 2016 blocks have a newer block version, the blocks with the\nolder version are rejected.\n\n**NOTE**: **block version** here and later has the same meaning as the\n**protocol version**.\n\nIt may seem unclear why we would like to make some block version invalid at some\nmoment. The key insight here is that a new feature is actually a restriction on\nwhat we had had previously. For example, currently we have plain old\ntransactions which may contain either PublicKey-based addresses or Script-based\nones. Then at some point we decide to include a third address type (no matter\nwhat its purpose is). Which strategy do we need for verifying a block with a\ntransaction with an address of unknown type? Obviously the only option is not\nverifying this address.\n\nThen imagine somebody proposing a transaction to this address, possibly doing\nthat with an intention to secure funds from being spent until some conditions\nare met — and then watching them being spent in some other transaction in a\nblock with version 1. This is the point. We cannot make use of a restriction\nwithout waiting for the network to start assuming the old version to be\ndeprecated (since we can only start rejecting blocks when their version is\ndeprecated).\n\nWe also cannot bluntly accept all blocks with a version that is higher than the\none currently adopted, since in our implementation every block has a special field\nwhich is used for storing auxiliary information. An attacker can claim she uses a\nhigher version of the protocol and generate a block whose `attributes` are polluted\nwith meaningless keys. If we accept it, it will bloat the blockchain.\n\nThis is the motivation for the logic described below.\n\nIn our implementation, a block version can exist in the following states:\n\n-   **Adopted**, when the soft fork resolution rule (see below) for a confirmed\n    block version is triggered.\n-   **Confirmed**, when there is an update proposal that contains a confirmed\n    version of the software and this block version. Note that \"confirmed version\n    of the software\" is a technical term defined\n    [elsewhere](/cardano/update-mechanism/#soft-fork-updates). If there are\n    multiple block versions where corresponding software is confirmed, but these\n    versions aren't adopted, we call them **competing**.

In this case the versions that\n    are competing are `2.0.0`, `2.0.1`, `1.2.0` and `1.2.1`.

Cardano SL is based on the Haskell implementation of the white paper “Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof of Stake Blockchain Protocol” by Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russell, Bernardo David and Roman Oliynykov.\n\nYou can think of Cardano SL as Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix Bitcoin’s design flaws. Please read “What Makes Cardano SL Special?” for more information about similarities and differences between Cardano SL and Bitcoin.\nCRYPTOCURRENCY BASICS\nBefore giving a definition of a cryptocurrency, let’s talk about why we care about digital currencies in general and cryptographic currencies in particular.\n\n### WHY DO WE CARE?\n\n- ##### SPEED\nAs opposed to conventional (also known as fiat), centrally banked currencies, such as the Yen or the American Dollar, digital currencies do not require a banking system to move value. With this restriction lifted, working with digital currencies is much faster than working with banking, especially on a global scale. Transferring 10 USD from Osaka to Denver no longer takes days when a digital currency is used. All transactions are made rapidly regardless of the distance.\n- ##### YOU OWN YOUR MONEY\nAll that a commercial bank account owner is given is a promise of being paid a certain amount of money within a reasonable amount of time after receiving a payout request. Banking systems also have limits to any volume of value being moved, rendering an individual unable to withdraw or transfer large amounts quickly. In case of cryptocurrencies, the person who holds a special kind of information called a secret key can spend the money at will. No other entity has a power to manipulate the value that a user owns.\n- ##### PSEUDONYMITY\nOne can have as many cryptocurrency addresses as they wish, receiving and spending money from different addresses as per their purpose. A merchant running an E-Commerce shop can have a set of addresses for receiving money and issuing refunds, and a separate personal “wallet” for their own needs. A single interface is used to control all of these wallets, and there is no need to log in to several payment platforms, which makes the process very time-efficient.\n- ##### SECURITY\nYour money is as secure as the secret key that allows spending it. This means that storing your secret key on a USB flash drive in a safe is equivalent to having banknotes in a safe. Absolutely nobody can steal this money even by carrying out a successful cyberattack.\n\n### EXTENSIBILITY\nUsing an approach known as side chains, general purpose cryptocurrencies such as Cardano SL or Bitcoin can enable domain specific cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum Classic. This way, any innovation developed via domain specific cryptocurrency can have participants who hold value in a general purpose cryptocurrency. Examples of such applications are identity management, gaming and gambling, and verifiable computations.\n\n### WHAT IS A CRYPTOCURRENCY?\nCryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that uses cryptography to manipulate value. Cryptography provides a way to generate proof of genuine authenticity of any kind of information. This is called digital signing. In cryptocurrencies we generate a ledger (a database which provides information on how much money each address has) by signing and sending transactions to the network and receiving blocks of confirmed transactions. Cryptocurrencies are normally decentralized, meaning that many people from all over the globe participate in ledger generation by running cryptocurrency nodes. Thus, a consensus about the state of the ledger has to be achieved. Two most significant approaches for achieving such consensus are discussed in the next section.\n\n### WHAT MAKES CARDANO SL SPECIAL?\nWhile there are similarities between Bitcoin and Cardano SL, there are also many differences between these two cryptocurrencies. The most significant difference is that Bitcoin is a proof of work type cryptocurrency, while Cardano SL makes use of a proof of stake approach to reach consensus. This encourages honesty and long term participation.\n\n### PURPOSE OF A CONSENSUS ALGORITHM\nConsensus algorithms are used to produce new transaction blocks, resulting in an updated state of the ledger. Whenever someone publishes a block of transactions, they — or rather, their node that runs the cryptocurrency protocol — have to attach a proof that they have merited it. Below two types of such proofs are discussed.\n\n### PROOF OF WORK AND MINING\nProof of work is the most common consensus algorithm type for cryptocurrencies. It originated in Bitcoin, and this is how this cryptocurrency works. To generate proof of work, a computer has to solve a challenge. The challenge is a computationally heavy problem which is hard to solve, but the solution is easy to verify. When a computer on a proof of work based network finds a solution, it publishes it along with the transactions that the computer has been observing while cracking the problem. The owner of this computer collects the transaction fees and a reward for generating a block. The entire process is called mining. Mining is very energy consuming, and the amount of energy needed is constantly increasing, which can lead to unsound competition.\n\n### PROOF OF STAKE AND MINTING\nProof of stake is a novel approach to block generation. IOHK scientists led by Prof. Aggelos Kiayias have designed the first provably secure proof of stake algorithm called Ouroboros. Ouroboros lies at the heart of Cardano SL. Research team has published a white paper that is a worthy read for anyone with a background in cryptocurrency theory. The core idea of proof of stake is that instead of wasting electricity on cracking computationally heavy problems, a node is selected to mint a new block, with a probability proportional to the amount of coins this node has. If a node has positive (> 0) stake, it is called a stakeholder. If a node eventually becomes chosen to mint a block, it is called a slot leader. You can read more about this process in Proof of Stake in Cardano SL.\n\n### BEYOND SETTLEMENT LAYER\nCardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason. It is the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish such tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the application of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity management, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL wallet application, into a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.",

Cardano SL is based on the Haskell implementation of the white paper “Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof of Stake Blockchain Protocol” by Aggelos Kiayias, Alexander Russell, Bernardo David and Roman Oliynykov.\n\nYou can think of Cardano SL as Bitcoin reimagined with a freedom to fix Bitcoin’s design flaws. Please read “What Makes Cardano SL Special?” for more information about similarities and differences between Cardano SL and Bitcoin.\nCRYPTOCURRENCY BASICS\nBefore giving a definition of a cryptocurrency, let’s talk about why we care about digital currencies in general and cryptographic currencies in particular.\n\n### WHY DO WE CARE?\n\n- ##### SPEED\nAs opposed to conventional (also known as fiat), centrally banked currencies, such as the Yen or the American Dollar, digital currencies do not require a banking system to move value. With this restriction lifted, working with digital currencies is much faster than working with banking, especially on a global scale. Transferring 10 USD from Osaka to Denver no longer takes days when a digital currency is used. All transactions are made rapidly regardless of the distance.\n- ##### YOU OWN YOUR MONEY\nAll that a commercial bank account owner is given is a promise of being paid a certain amount of money within a reasonable amount of time after receiving a payout request. Banking systems also have limits to any volume of value being moved, rendering an individual unable to withdraw or transfer large amounts quickly. In case of cryptocurrencies, the person who holds a special kind of information called a secret key can spend the money at will. No other entity has a power to manipulate the value that a user owns.\n- ##### PSEUDONYMITY\nOne can have as many cryptocurrency addresses as they wish, receiving and spending money from different addresses as per their purpose. A merchant running an E-Commerce shop can have a set of addresses for receiving money and issuing refunds, and a separate personal “wallet” for their own needs. A single interface is used to control all of these wallets, and there is no need to log in to several payment platforms, which makes the process very time-efficient.\n- ##### SECURITY\nYour money is as secure as the secret key that allows spending it. This means that storing your secret key on a USB flash drive in a safe is equivalent to having banknotes in a safe. Absolutely nobody can steal this money even by carrying out a successful cyberattack.\n\n### EXTENSIBILITY\nUsing an approach known as side chains, general purpose cryptocurrencies such as Cardano SL or Bitcoin can enable domain specific cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum Classic. This way, any innovation developed via domain specific cryptocurrency can have participants who hold value in a general purpose cryptocurrency. Examples of such applications are identity management, gaming and gambling, and verifiable computations.\n\n### WHAT IS A CRYPTOCURRENCY?\nCryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that uses cryptography to manipulate value. Cryptography provides a way to generate proof of genuine authenticity of any kind of information. This is called digital signing. In cryptocurrencies we generate a ledger (a database which provides information on how much money each address has) by signing and sending transactions to the network and receiving blocks of confirmed transactions. Cryptocurrencies are normally decentralized, meaning that many people from all over the globe participate in ledger generation by running cryptocurrency nodes. Thus, a consensus about the state of the ledger has to be achieved. Two most significant approaches for achieving such consensus are discussed in the next section.\n\n### WHAT MAKES CARDANO SL SPECIAL?\nWhile there are similarities between Bitcoin and Cardano SL, there are also many differences between these two cryptocurrencies. The most significant difference is that Bitcoin is a proof of work type cryptocurrency, while Cardano SL makes use of a proof of stake approach to reach consensus. This encourages honesty and long term participation.\n\n### PURPOSE OF A CONSENSUS ALGORITHM\nConsensus algorithms are used to produce new transaction blocks, resulting in an updated state of the ledger. Whenever someone publishes a block of transactions, they — or rather, their node that runs the cryptocurrency protocol — have to attach a proof that they have merited it. Below two types of such proofs are discussed.\n\n### PROOF OF WORK AND MINING\nProof of work is the most common consensus algorithm type for cryptocurrencies. It originated in Bitcoin, and this is how this cryptocurrency works. To generate proof of work, a computer has to solve a challenge. The challenge is a computationally heavy problem which is hard to solve, but the solution is easy to verify. When a computer on a proof of work based network finds a solution, it publishes it along with the transactions that the computer has been observing while cracking the problem. The owner of this computer collects the transaction fees and a reward for generating a block. The entire process is called mining. Mining is very energy consuming, and the amount of energy needed is constantly increasing, which can lead to unsound competition.\n\n### PROOF OF STAKE AND MINTING\nProof of stake is a novel approach to block generation. IOHK scientists led by Prof. Aggelos Kiayias have designed the first provably secure proof of stake algorithm called Ouroboros. Ouroboros lies at the heart of Cardano SL. Research team has published a white paper that is a worthy read for anyone with a background in cryptocurrency theory. The core idea of proof of stake is that instead of wasting electricity on cracking computationally heavy problems, a node is selected to mint a new block, with a probability proportional to the amount of coins this node has. If a node has positive (> 0) stake, it is called a stakeholder. If a node eventually becomes chosen to mint a block, it is called a slot leader. You can read more about this process in Proof of Stake in Cardano SL.\n\n### BEYOND SETTLEMENT LAYER\nCardano SL is called “Layer” for a reason. It is the first component of the Cardano Platform. Eventually, it will be expanded with a Control Layer, serving as a trusted computation framework to evaluate a special kind of proofs to ensure that a certain computation was carried out correctly. In gaming and gambling, such systems are used for verifying honesty of random number generation and game outcomes. Accompanied with side chains, it will make possible to accomplish such tasks as provably fair distribution of winnings in games. But the application of Control Layer lies well beyond gaming and gambling. Identity management, credit system and more will be a part of Cardano Platform. We are also aiming to evolve Daedalus, the Cardano SL wallet application, into a universal cryptocurrency wallet featuring automated cryptocurrency trading and cryptocurrency-to-fiat transactions.",

However, there are no details on how to obtain the current time value securely\nand with enough precision.\n\nIn Cardano SL, the current time value is obtained from a user's computer system time value.\n\nWe also have a feature to notify users if their system time is incorrect\n(we compare it with the time value that is obtained from NTP servers). This feature is planned for a future release.\n\n## Coin Tossing and Verifiable Secret Sharing\n\nThe paper suggests PVSS (Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing) scheme by Schoenmakers for Cardano SL. However,\ncurrently Cardano SL uses [\"SCRAPE: Scalable Randomness Attested by\nPublic Entities\"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/216.pdf) PVSS scheme.\n\nOne of the challenges while using a VSS (Verifiable Secret Sharing) scheme is associating the\npublic key used for signing with the public key used for the VSS scheme\n(`VssPublicKey`). This is solved by introducing `VssCertificate`s. This\ncertificate is a signature given by a signing key for a pair consisting of\n`VssPublicKey` and the epoch until which this certificate is valid. Initially,\nall stakeholders with stake enough for participation in randomness generation\nhold certificates. When a new stakeholder with enough stake appears, or when an\nexisting certificate expires, a new certificate should be generated and\nsubmitted to the network. `VssCertificate`s are stored in blocks.\n\nPVSS scheme uses share verification information which also\nincludes a commitment to the secret. It is also used as a commitment in\nthe protocol. The PVSS scheme has been implemented over the elliptic curve\nsecp256r1. Please refer to [PVSS implementation in Cardano\nSL](/technical/pvss/) for more details.\n\n## Block Generation Time\n\nIn the paper, they do not state explicitly when a slot leader should\ngenerate a new block and send it to the network: it can be done at the beginning\nof a slot, at the end of a slot, in the middle of a slot, etc. In Cardano SL\nthere is a special constant called \"network diameter\" which approximates maximal time\nnecessary to broadcast a block to all nodes in the network. For example, if network\ndiameter is 3, then block is generated and announced 3 seconds before the end of a slot.\n\n## Stake Delegation\n\nDelegation scheme, as described in the paper, does not explicitly state whether proxy\nsigning certificates should be stored within the blockchain (though there is a\nsuggestion to store the revocation list in the blockchain). Without storing\nproxy signing certificates in the blockchain it is barely possible to consider\ndelegated stake in checking eligibility threshold. On the other hand, if all\ncertificates are stored in the blockchain, it may lead to a blockchain bloat\nwhen a big portion of blocks will be occupied by proxy certificates. Submitting\na certificate is free, so adversaries can generate as many certificates as they\nwant.\n\nThere are two types of delegation in Cardano SL: heavyweight and lightweight.\nThere is a threshold on stake that one has to posses in order to participate in\nheavyweight delegation. Proxy signing certificates from heavyweight delegation\nare stored within the blockchain. On the contrary, lightweight delegation is\navailable for everybody, but certificates are not stored within the blockchain\nand are not considered when checking eligibility threshold. As the paper suggests,\n*delegation-by-proxy* scheme is used.\n\nPlease read about [Stake Delegation in Cardano SL](/technical/delegation/) for\nimplementation details.\n\n# Modifications\n\n## Leader Selection Process\n\nIn the paper, Leader Selection Process is described as flipping a\n`(1 - p₁) … (1 - pⱼ₋₁) pⱼ`-biased coin to see whether the `j`-th stakeholder is\nselected as the leader of the given slot. Here `pⱼ` is probability of selecting the `j`-th\nstakeholder.\n\nIn Cardano SL, it is implemented in a slightly different way. `R` random\nnumbers in a range `[0 .. totalCoins]` are generated, where `R` is a number of\nslots in an epoch. Stakeholders occupy different subsegments on this range,\nproportional to their stakes. This way, each random number maps into stakeholder.\nAlso, as the paper suggests, a short (32-bits) seed is used for initializing PRG\ninstead of using `n ⌈log λ⌉` random bits.\n\nPlease read about [Leader Selection in Cardano SL](/technical/leader-selection/)\nfor implementation details.\n\n## Commitments, openings, shares sending\n\nTime of sending is randomized within a small interval. It is done to avoid network\noverload when all coin-tossing participants send their data at the same time.\nThis interval is chosen to be small enough for protocol to remain secure. If\nthis data is sent too late and there are many adversaries leading last few slots\nof a certain phase, it can happen that data will not be included into the block.\n\n## Multishares\n\nIn the paper, each stakeholder is presented as exactly one participant of the\nunderlying VSS scheme. However, it is natural that a stakeholder with more stake\nis more important than a stakeholder with less stake with regards to secret\nsharing. For instance, if three honest stakeholders control 60% of stake in\ntotal (each of them controls 20%) and there are 40 adversary stakeholders each\nhaving 1% of stake, then the adversary has full control over secret sharing.\n\nTo overcome this problem, a number of shares for each stakeholder proportional\nto their stake is generated in Cardano SL.\n\n## Randomness Generation Failure\n\nThe paper does not cover the situation when commitments cannot be recovered.\nHowever, a practical implementation should account for such scenarios.\nCardano SL implementation uses a seed consisting of all zeroes if there are no\ncommitments that could be recovered.\n\n# Added Features\n\n## Update System\n\nSee the article on [update system](/cardano/update-mechanism/).\n\n## Security of P2P\n\nSee the article on [P2P implementation and\nhardening](/technical/protocols/p2p/).\n\n# Omissions\n\nThe sections on *Input Endorsers* and *Incentive Structure* are not implemented\nyet. Those sections are to be implemented together with the pending research on\nSide-chains and released within the Side-chains release.\n",
