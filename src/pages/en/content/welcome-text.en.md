Dear reader, the purpose of this documentation is to provide you with understanding of the first layer of Cardano Platform stack, the Settlement Layer. If you have an understanding of what Settlement Layer is, we suggest you first read [Differences Between the Paper and the Implementation](/cardano/differences/), and then move on to documentation on [protocols and implementation](/technical/protocols/csl-application-level/).

This documentation targets IOHK developers, third party software developers, auditors, and consultants who collaborate on implementing Cardano Settlement Layer or use Cardano Settlement Layer reference implementation.
